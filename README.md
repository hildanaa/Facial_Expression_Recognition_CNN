# Facial Expression Recognition (FER)

A computer vision project that detects and classifies human facial expressions using machine learning techniques.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **facial expression recognition (FER)** — the task of automatically identifying human emotions from facial images.  
The goal is to build and evaluate a model capable of classifying facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality.

## Objectives

- Preprocess and analyze facial image data
- Train a machine learning / deep learning model for emotion classification
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Visualize predictions and results

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**
  - NumPy
  - OpenCV
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow / Keras 
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Image normalization and resizing
   - Label encoding for facial expressions
   - Train / validation split

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Pixel-based features or CNN-based representation
   - Optional face detection preprocessing

3. **Model Training**
   - Machine learning or deep learning classifier
   - Hyperparameter tuning where applicable

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy and loss tracking
   - Confusion matrix and classification report
   - Visual inspection of predictions

## Results

- The model demonstrates the ability to distinguish between multiple facial expressions
- Performance varies across emotion classes, with stronger results for more distinct expressions
- Visualizations and evaluation outputs are included in the notebook
